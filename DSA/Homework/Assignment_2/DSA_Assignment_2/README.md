# Instructions
1. Add bst.c and bst.h in this folder
2. All function declarations, structs and header files must be declared in the file bst.h
3. bst.c must have only one header- bst.h
4. main.c has the following 5 functions (corresponding to problem 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 resp):
test_bstsort();
test_finddepth();
test_height();
test_isbst();
test_inRange();
Uncomment only the function you want to run, while keeping the other functions commented
5. Run the script merge.sh as ```bash merge.sh```. This will generate a file a2.c
6. a2.c is what you need to submit
7. Every function must print the required output 
8. Problem specific instructions:
a. Problem 1: The output has to be in ascending order
b. Problem 5: Evaluation will be manual
